Implemented the following two models:

a.  MNIST handwritten data set using FNN model architecture along with Pytorch 

b.  Sentiment Analsys of movie reviews using LSTM and Pytorch

Classifying movie reviews of data-set mentioned in Pang and Lee, 2005 and handling out of vocabulary words and variable length sequences using Pytorchâ€™s torchtext and Pack Padding sequence respectively along with GloVe word embeddings for model.
